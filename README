This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2688

On VIM, it uses dark colors.
On GVIM, it uses bright colors without bold, italic nor 
underline font styles (except for spell checking and 
some GUI elements).
Only standard (for all languages) highlight-groups are set.
This colorscheme _should_ look nice everywhere.
